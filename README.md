# NEETS LIVE
This project was inspired by (ip2.online), this project aim to replicate what ip2.online does but to other streamers that are not part of IP2. User can change the list of streamers that they want to put on their own list by adding or removing them from the config.json (currently only working on Kick.com streamers).

TODO List:
- Add YT and Twitch
- Sort by view count (?)
- Change the theme color
